This revision provides stronger network data security protection via the below mechanisms to prevent malicious firmware from being upgraded to the UPS through communication interface ports.

Change logs:
1. The mechanism of firmware signing adds to the code in order to protect the UPS from malicious firmware spoofs. Based on the above, firmware upgrade via NMC is re-enabled. 
2. Added the selection of "FW Update Interfaces" under the LCD Menu->Configuration. This can assist the user to decide whether or not firmware upgrades are allowed through designated communication ports.
3. Changed TLS used for SmartConnect to MbedTLS for cybersecurity.

Note: Smart-UPS Firmware Upgrade Wizard tool 
always includes the latest released firmware and helps upgrade the UPS code via serial(RS232) port; Upgrade via USB port from this tool is not recommended.
