Changes between UPS 03.5 and UPS 04.1:
	1. Improved charging profile for SMT750IC and SMT750RMI2UC.
	2. Added feature of Modbus over TCP for SMT series.
	3. Implemented EnergyStar2.0 features to SMT and SMC series.
	4. Removed output voltage setting for 127V but added 125V setting. 
	5. Supported a new Modbus 32 bit VoltageACSetting_BF at Modbus memory map address 644.

Bugfixes between UPS 03.5 and UPS 04.1
	1. Fixed the problem that the upper acceptable limit can't be set to 276V when output voltage setting is 240V. 
	2. Fixed the problem of two report usages of USB HID on ShutdownImminent and DelayBeforeReboot.
	3. Fixed that the minimum and maximum limit for reported usages of battery run time and shutdown countdown in an application of Linux, NUT.
	4. Fixed that unit did not properly show battery temperature in °F below freezing
	5. Fixed the problem that PCBE USB communication occasionally stopped at Windows 10.
	6. Fixed the problem that RemainingTimeLimit and AudibleAlarmControl misuse mutually in USB report lufa APC asyncs.
	7. Fixed the problem that the Battery RBC string sent to cloud containing garbage letters.
	8. Fixed the problem that once the TCP port 502 was connected by a TCP client, other Modbus master could not connect to that port anymore.
	9. Fixed the problem that unit did not properly show battery temperature in °F below freezing.
	10. Fixed the problem that a retransfer point and transfer point at the same point when output voltage is set for 125V and quality is set poor.
